# Simon Game
Simon Game is a browser-based game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of randomly generated colors and sounds. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
Open the index.html file in your web browser.<br>
Enjoy playing the game!

## Usage
To play the game, simply follow these instructions:

Press any button to begin the game.<br>
Watch and listen as the buttons light up and play sounds in a certain order.<br>
Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.<br>
Each time you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add one more button to the sequence.<br>
If you make a mistake, the game will start over.<br>
Keep playing to see how long you can last!<br>
The buttons are randomly generated, and the sequence becomes longer and more complex as the game progresses.
